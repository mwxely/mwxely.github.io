I am an incoming Ph.D. student with [Visual Intelligence Lab](https://sg-vilab.github.io/) at the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse), [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/). I am luckily supervised by brilliant and kind [Prof. Shijian Lu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/shijian.lu/). Prior to joining NTU, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computing Science from [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html) in 2021. I am also working as research intern at [ByteDance AI Lab, Singapore](https://www.bytedance.com/en/), supervised by [Dr. Song Bai](https://songbai.site/).

My research interests lie broadly in the realms of deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing. I have been exploring the following research directions:

* AI-generated Images as Data Source ([AIGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01830))<br>
* Natural Language Generation ([FACE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10307))<br>
* Multimodal Large Language Model (WIP)<br>

Feel free to [reach out to me](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ru6JmlBLg1KN7Ht2aOeUuhHty-f3R5w2/view?usp=sharing) for collaborations, questions, or just to chat!
