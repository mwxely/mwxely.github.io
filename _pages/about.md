I am a second-year Ph.D. student with [Visual Intelligence Lab](https://sg-vilab.github.io/) at [Nanyang Technological University](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/), supervised by [Prof. Shijian Lu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/shijian.lu/). Prior to joining NTU, I obtained my B.S. degree in Computing Science from [University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/index.html). I also work closely with [Dr. Lidong Bing](https://lidongbing.github.io/) at [MiroMind AI](https://miromind.ai/) and [Dr. Song Bai](https://songbai.site/) at [ByteDance](https://www.bytedance.com/en/). My research interests lie broadly in the realms of video processing, spanning generation, understanding, reasoning, and agentic tool use.

Feel free to [reach out to me](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ru6JmlBLg1KN7Ht2aOeUuhHty-f3R5w2/view?usp=sharing) for collaborations, questions, or just to chat!
